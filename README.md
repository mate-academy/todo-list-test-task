# Todo list

In this task, you have to implement a todo list site.

## Steps for implementation

1. Create pull request;
2. Switch to your branch;
3. Implement Todo List using Django;
4. Create Pull Request from your_branch to main branch;

## Task

You should have such models:
1. Task - todo list is consist of todo_list. Each task should have fields for:
    - content - describes what you should do.
    - datetime, when a task was created
    - optional deadline datetime if a task should be done until some
datetime
    - the boolean field that marks if the task is done or not
    - tags that are relevant for this task
2. Tag - a tag symbolizes the theme of the task and consists only of a name.

A task can have multiple tags and a tag can be in multiple todo_list.

Create the home page. The home page is accessed by `127.0.0.1:8000/`, where you
should have:
1. Sidebar with the links to:
   - Home page
   - Tag list page
    the sidebar should be on all pages.
2. Todo list which is a list of todo_list.
   - todo_list should be ordered from `not done` to `done` and from newest to oldest
   - All task information should be displayed.
   - There should be a button to add a new task.
   - For each task add links for updating and deletion.
   - Also, add a button `Complete` if a task is not done and `Undo` if a task is
done, this button changes the status of the task to the opposite and redirects
to this page.

The home page should look like this:

Of course, pages for adding tags and todo_list must be also implemented.
